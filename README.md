# 🐍 Python Heuristic Search Project

This repository contains an implementation stub for solving a heuristic-based search problem. The `Bear_problem` class is structured to be completed by implementing a state representation and heuristic function as specified in the related problem description. 🏗️

## 🚀 Interesting Techniques Used

- **⭐ A* Search Algorithm**: A common heuristic search technique used in pathfinding and AI. The implementation can be extended to support A* search, leveraging priority queues for optimal path discovery. Learn more about [A* Search here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
- **📌 Priority Queue with `heapq`**: The script imports [`heapq`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html), a built-in Python module for implementing an efficient priority queue, commonly used in pathfinding and search algorithms.
- **🛠️ Object-Oriented Design**: The problem is encapsulated within a class, `Bear_problem`, promoting modularity and ease of testing.

## 📦 Dependencies & Technologies

This script uses only Python standard libraries, ensuring broad compatibility without external dependencies.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

/
├── bear.py  # Main implementation file

- **`bear.py`**: Contains the stub for the `Bear_problem` class, which needs a state representation and heuristic definition. The `main()` function is predefined and should not be modified, but additional unit tests can be added to `unit_tests()`.

## ⚡ Notes

- ✅ Ensure that any additions to the script follow the intended problem constraints.
- 🏃 Execution is expected via `python3 bear.py` from the terminal.
- 🔒 The `main()` function is not meant to be edited, preserving compatibility with automated testing.
